## Hi there

This is the place where I opensource stuff and break things :rofl:

- 🎮 &nbsp;I'm Always focusing on clean codes and structures. It makes developing enjoyable as much as playing a game! :wink:
- ✅ &nbsp;I'm in love with those green checkmarks which appear one by one after running unit tests!
- 👨‍💻 &nbsp;I have the biggest passion to learn more about blockchain and to keep my skills up to date in the world of blockchain, which is changing day by day.
